# site name

When Google lists a page in search results, it shows the name of the site the page comes from. This is called the site name.

Note that the site name is different from the per-page title links (title links are specific to each web page, whereas the site name is for the entire site).

### videos
- use html elements used for embedding videos e:g `<video> <embed> <iframe> <object>`
- google identify videos on pages using the above tags, structured data markup and video sitemaps
