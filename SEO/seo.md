    - does the content provide a substantial, complete, or **conmprehensive description** of the topic?
    - does the content provide insightful analysis or interesting information that is **beyond the obvious**?
    - If the content draws on other sources, does it avoid simply copying or rewriting those sources, and instead provide substantial **additional value** and originality?
    - Does the **main heading or page title** provide a descriptive, helpful summary of the content?
    - Does the main heading or page title **avoid exaggerating** or being shocking in nature?
    - Is this the sort of page you'd want to **bookmark**, share with a friend, or recommend?
    - Would you expect to see this content in or **referenced by** a printed magazine, encyclopedia, or book?
    - Does the content provide **substantial value when compared to other pages** in search results?
    - Does the content have any **spelling or stylistic issues**?
    - Is the content **produced well**, or does it appear sloppy or hastily produced?
    - Is the content mass-produced by or outsourced to a large number of creators, or spread across a large network of sites, so that individual pages or sites don't get as much attention or care?
    - Does the content present information in a way that **makes you want to trust it**, such as clear sourcing, evidence of the expertise involved, background about the author or the site that publishes it, such as through links to an author page or a site's **About page**?
    - If someone researched the site producing the content, would they come away with an impression that it is well-trusted or widely-recognized as an authority on its topic?
    - Is this content written or **reviewed by an expert** or enthusiast who demonstrably knows the topic well?
    - Does the content have any **easily-verified factual errors**?
