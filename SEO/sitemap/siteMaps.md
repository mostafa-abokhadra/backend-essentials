### sitemaps
A sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them.

Search engines like Google read this file to crawl your site more efficiently. A sitemap tells search engines which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files. For example, when the page was last updated and any alternate language versions of the page.

If your site's pages are properly linked, Google can usually discover most of your site

#### you might need a sitemap if
- Your site is large
- Your site is new and has few external links to it
-  site has a lot of rich media content (video, images) or is shown in Google News.
