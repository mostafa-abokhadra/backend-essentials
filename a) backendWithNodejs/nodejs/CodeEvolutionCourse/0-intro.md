# NodeJS

- **open source:** source code is publicly available for sharing and modification
- **cross platform:** available on Mac, windows and linux
- **javascript runtime environment**: ?
- it builds end-to-end js application
- it is not a language, it's not a framework , **it's a run time environment**

### ECMA SCRIPT stroy 
- list to the story and the difference between ECMAscript and js [here](https://youtu.be/HXpPKhWOkAs?si=8LoZL3M57CzPTIpo)

### JS engine
- it is the program that converts js code to the machine code, each browser has it's own engine
- **V8** is the engine developed by google for chrome
- **spidermonkey** developed by mozilla for firefox
- **jsCore** developed by apple for safari
- **chakra** for microsoft edge (now uses V8)

> [!NOTE]
> - V8 engine is written using C++, so you can embed V8 engine in your C++ application
> - you can write C++ code that get executed when the user write js code, in other words you can add new features to js itself

> [!TIP]
> - since C++ is great for lower level operations like file handling, database conncetions and network operations, by embedding V8 into your own C++ program you have the power to add all of that functionaliy in js
> - the C++ program we're talking about is nothing but Node js

### js runtime
- js runtime is an environment which provides all the necessary components in order to use and run js program <mark>outside the browser</mark>
- js runtime consists of js engine, web APIs, Queue and events loop
- V8 js engine which is a one component of js runtime consists of Call stack where js code get executed and memory to store the variables
- web APIs refers to DOM, TIMERS e:g setTimeout and setIntervals, promises, and Browser storage that add functionality to the js engine but not a part of js lang itself, these api are provided by the browser
- QUEUE is where asynchronous tasks wait before get executed
- Event loop ensures that async tasks are executed in the right order

### what can you build with Node js
- websites
- backend services like APIs
- real time applications
- streaming services like Netflex
- CLI tools
- Multiplayer games
