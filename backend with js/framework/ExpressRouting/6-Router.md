### express.Router()

### What is `Express.Router()`?

In Express, the `Router` is a mini Express application that doesn’t have all the features of an entire app but can handle routing and middleware separately. It allows you to create a modular structure by grouping related routes and middlewares together. You can then mount this router into your main application.

### Why use `Express.Router()`?

As your application grows, managing all the routes in a single file becomes difficult. Without routing, everything would be done in one large app file (`app.js` or `server.js`), which can get complex and harder to maintain. `Express.Router()` allows you to break up the routing part of the code into separate files, creating a cleaner and more modular structure.

For example, if your application handles users, products, orders, etc., you can create separate routers for each feature. This way, the code for handling user-related routes is kept separate from product-related routes.

### How to use `Express.Router()`?

#### 1. **Create a Router:**

You create a router instance by calling `express.Router()`. This gives you a mini app to define your routes for specific sections of your application.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
```

#### 2. **Define Routes on the Router:**

Once you have a router instance, you can define routes just like you would in an Express application. For example, for a router handling users, you can define routes like:

```javascript
// GET request to /users
router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
});

// GET request to /users/:id
router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User details for ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

Here, the `/users` route will respond with a list of users, and `/users/:id` responds with details for a specific user.

#### 3. **Mount the Router in the Main Application:**

In the main application file (usually `app.js` or `server.js`), you mount the router to handle specific paths using `app.use()`. This tells the Express app to use the router for routes that match the specified path prefix.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = require('./userRouter'); // Assume we define the user router in a separate file

// Mount the user router at the path /api
app.use('/api', userRouter);

// Server setup
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, `app.use('/api', userRouter)` tells Express to use `userRouter` for any route that starts with `/api`. So if the router has a route defined as `/users`, it will actually respond to `/api/users`.

#### 4. **Using Multiple Routers:**

You can create multiple routers for different features of your application. For example, you can have a `productRouter` and `orderRouter` as well:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const userRouter = require('./userRouter');
const productRouter = require('./productRouter');
const orderRouter = require('./orderRouter');

// Mount routers
app.use('/api/users', userRouter);
app.use('/api/products', productRouter);
app.use('/api/orders', orderRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

- Requests starting with `/api/users` will be handled by the `userRouter`.
- Requests starting with `/api/products` will be handled by `productRouter`.
- Requests starting with `/api/orders` will be handled by `orderRouter`.

This modular structure keeps your application clean and manageable.

### Middleware in Routers

You can also add middleware to specific routers. For example, if you want to authenticate or validate data for routes related to users, you can add middleware specific to the user router:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Middleware that runs before any user route
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('User middleware running');
  next();
});

// Define user routes
router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
});

router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User details for ID ${req.params.id}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```

In this example:
- The middleware function runs for every request made to the routes defined in the router.
- Middleware helps to perform tasks like logging, authentication, or validation before reaching the actual route handler.

### Router Parameters

You can use route parameters with `Express.Router()` to make your routes dynamic. For example, routes like `/users/:id` can use parameters like `:id` to respond to requests based on the user's ID.

```javascript
router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});
```

### Organizing with Multiple Files

For a more organized codebase, each router can be placed in its own file, and you can import them into your main app:

- `app.js`: The main application file.
- `routes/userRoutes.js`: The file for all user-related routes.
- `routes/productRoutes.js`: The file for product-related routes.

**Example: `userRoutes.js`**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define user-related routes
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('All users');
});

router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Example: `app.js`**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Import routers
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
const productRoutes = require('./routes/productRoutes');

// Use routers
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
app.use('/api/products', productRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Benefits of Using `Express.Router()`
1. **Modularity**: Makes it easier to divide large applications into smaller, manageable parts.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each router can handle a specific area of the application (e.g., users, products).
3. **Reusability**: The same router can be reused in multiple places if necessary.
4. **Middleware Scoping**: Middleware can be applied to specific routers, making it easier to handle logic specific to certain routes or groups of routes.

By organizing your routes with `Express.Router()`, you can keep your codebase modular, maintainable, and scalable, especially as the app grows in complexity!

### router.route
- to specify deferent method for the same route
```js
router.route("/:id")
  .get("getcodeNormally")
  .put("putcode")
  .delete()
```
### router.param
- to run specific code whenever certain paramter is send with the request
- you should call next() function after your code
```js
router.param("id", (req, res, next, id) => {
    // code
    next()
})
```
