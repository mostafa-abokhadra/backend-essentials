### express-validators
#### importance of validating user inputs
1. **Prevention from Injection Attacks**: Consider a scenario where your application is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. This vulnerability arises due to the poor handling of SQL code during user authentication through an authentication form. An attacker can exploit this by passing some malicious SQL code instead of user credentials and gaining access to the server, which is game over for the application.

2. **Data Integrity and Consistency**: When user input is validated, it creates consistency in data being stored in servers, thus making it complicated to work with the data. For example, if a user can send text data in input for age, it creates inconsistency in the data stored in the server.

3. **Data Compatibility**: The data type must be consistent when data is used at various endpoints in a big organization. For instance, if users can enter garbage data instead of a proper email in their email credentials, it could cause complications when the organization needs to contact the user.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**: When inputs are validated, a developer can create logic to send appropriate and immediate feedback to users, allowing them to correct the invalid input they provided. This enhances the overall User Experience.

### important terms
1. **Validator** : A validator is a function that takes input and performs certain checks based on some criteria.

2. **Sanitizer** : A sanitizer is a function used to modify or cleanse input data to ensure that it is secure and adheres to required formats.

3. **Validation Chain** : A validation chain in Express-Validator is a sequence of validators or sanitizers applied on an input. For example, assume that you have a form where you want users to enter their email and, to keep your data in the database consistent, you want no whitespaces to be allowed in the input (at left or right ends). You can use a validation chain like .isEmail() to achieve this.trim() [You will learn about these in a later section]. This will first check whether the input is an email; if it is email data, then the trim() sanitizer will remove whitespaces from both ends of the input.

### express-validator
- Express-Validator is a combination of middleware which provides validators and sanitizers for string data types
- create middleware to validate the inputs every time a user signs up for your server.
```bash
npm install express-validator
```
```js
const { body, validationResult } = require("express-validator");
app.post(
  "/signup",
  // using validation to verify valid inputs (MIDDLEWARE)
  [
    [
      body("name").notEmpty(),
      body("email").isEmail(),
      body("password").notEmpty(),
    ],
  ],
  async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);

    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
      }

    res.status(200).json({success:'Successful Sign Up!'})
  }
);
```
- The `body()` method is used to create validation chains for validating and selecting input data from request payloads( req) from users, such as data sent by a POST request.
- The `validationResult()` method stores the result of a validation chain of an HTTP request as a JavaScript object. If this object is empty, it implies that the payload has passed all validation tests; if not, it stores information about the payload and the criteria it did not satisfy.
- The body() method of the Express-Validator fetches the values of HTML components having the name attribute same as the argument of the body() method; i.e., body(“password”) will fetch the value of HTML input component having the name attribute as password.
- Then, on these values, you can use the validators provided by Express-Validator. In this example, we have used two validators, isEmail() and notEmpty(). These validators determine whether the input is email and not empty, respectively. If the input does not match the criteria of the validator(s), the Express-Validator will throw an error as an object in the form of the validationResult(). However, if the input matches the criteria of the applied validators, the validationResult() object will be empty. This is then used inside the function definition of the ‘/signup’ route to create a simple check using if statement. Suppose the validationResult() array is not empty. In that case, an error with response code 400 is sent to the client.

### common validatros
- can be used in the same manner as isEmail() and notEmpty().
#### isDate()
#### isEmpty()
#### isHash(algorithm)
Checks if the Input is a hash. The argument takes the hashing algorithm such as MD5, SHA, etc.
#### isJWT()
Checks if the Input is a JWT(JavaScript Web Token).
#### isURL()
#### isBoolean()
#### isNumeric()
#### isAlphanumeric()
#### isInt()
#### isDecimal()
#### isFloat()

### validate file inputs 
- handle file inputs and validate them before uploading them to a server to avoid uploading malicious files on your server. In addition to this security benefit, you can put constraints on the file input size, ensuring no large files fill up your server.
- we will do that using multer packages
```bash
npm i multer
```
```js
const multer = require('multer')
```
```js
// CREATING MIDDLEWARE USING MULTER TO HANDLE UPLOADS
// creating a storage object for multer
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  // providing the destinations for files to be stored in server
  destination: "./uploads/",
 });
   // defining file storage to local disk and putting constraints on files being uploaded
  const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  limits: { fileSize: 1*1024*1024 }, // file size in bytes

  //   you can add other constraints according to your requirement such as file type, etc.
});
app.post(
  "/fileUpload",

  //   input validation for files to ensure only a single file is uploaded in one request
  upload.single("fileUpload"),

  // using validation to verify valid inputs
  [
    body("fileDescription").notEmpty(),
    // you can add as many validators as you require
  ],
  async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);

    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
const file = req.file;
    // perform any other tasks on the file or other form inputs

    res.status(200).json({ success: "Successful Sign Up!" });
  }
);
```
1. First, we define a storage category. Multer provides both disk storage and memory storage(buffer). In this example, we have used disk storage to store uploaded files on a server’s local disk instead of wasting memory.

2. When using disk storage, it is necessary to provide the directory location where uploaded files will be stored. This can be done using the destination keyword, which takes the path as a value. Here, we have used an uploads folder in the project directory itself.

3. After this, we create an upload object which handles the upload of files. This calls the multer import and takes a JavaScript object as input. This JavaScript object contains various constraints/validations to be satisfied before storing the input file on disk. Storage is a necessary argument that will take the storage object as input, defined before this.

4. We have added another validation using the limits option to ensure no file is greater than 1 MB. Note that it counts size in bytes.

5. Then, we create an Express route to handle file upload and add a middleware upload.single(), ensuring that only one file is uploaded in one request. It takes the input field named fileUpload from HTML DOM as the required argument.

6. After this, we add Express-Validator middleware, as explained in the previous section.

7. Lastly, we create the logic to handle the route and check for any errors in input validation.

8. You can access the uploaded file(s) from your route logic from the req.file object.

### sanitization of form object
```js
const { body, validationResult } = require("express-validator");
body("name").notEmpty().trim(),
body("email").isEmail().trim(),
body("dob").toDate(),
```

- In the dob input field, we use the toDate() sanitizer (without any validator) to convert the input string into a date object. If the string is not an actual date, toDate() will return a null value.

#### common string sanitizer
```js
trim(): //Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
escape(): //Escapes HTML special characters in a string to prevent XSS attacks.
normalizeEmail(): //Normalizes an email address to a consistent format.
lowerCase(): //Converts a string to lowercase.
upperCase(): //Converts a string to uppercase
```
#### Number sanitizers:
```js
toInt(): //Converts a string to an integer.
toFloat(): //Converts a string to a float.
```
#### Date sanitizers:
```js
toDate(): //Converts a string to a Date object.
isISO8601(): //Checks if a string is in ISO 8601 format.
```
### Boolean sanitizers:
```js
toBoolean(): //Converts a string to a boolean.
```
#### Custom sanitizers:
You can create your own custom sanitizers using the `sanitize()` method.

```js
const express = require('express');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

const app = express();

app.post('/users', [
  body('name').trim().escape().isLength({ min: 3 }).withMessage('Name must be at least 3 characters long'),
  body('email').normalizeEmail().isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email address'),
  body('age').toInt().isInt({ min: 18 }).withMessage('Must be at least 18 years old'),
], (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }

  // ...
});
```
