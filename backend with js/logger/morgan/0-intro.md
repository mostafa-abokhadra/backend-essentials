**`var logger = require('morgan');`**

This line of code imports the `morgan` module into your Node.js application. The `morgan` module is a popular tool for logging HTTP requests in Node.js applications. It provides a convenient way to record information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL, status code, response time, and more.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- **`var logger`:** This declares a variable named `logger` that will store the `morgan` module.
- **`require('morgan')`:** This uses the `require` function to load the `morgan` module. The `require` function is built into Node.js and is used to load external modules.

Once you've imported the `morgan` module, you can use it to log HTTP requests in your application. For example, you might use the following code to log all incoming requests in the combined format:

```javascript
app.use(logger('combined'));
```

This line of code adds a middleware function to your Express application that uses the `morgan` module to log all incoming requests in the combined format. The combined format includes the following information:

- Remote address of the client
- Date and time of the request
- Request method
- URL of the request
- HTTP status code
- Response time in milliseconds
- Bytes sent to the client
- User agent of the client

You can also use other logging formats provided by `morgan`, such as `common`, `short`, and `dev`.

By using `morgan`, you can gain valuable insights into the behavior of your Node.js application and help to troubleshoot problems.
