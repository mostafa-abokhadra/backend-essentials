## robots.txt
- A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. 
- it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, **block indexing with noindex** or password-protect the page.
- Warning: Don't use a robots.txt file as a means to hide your web pages (including PDFs and other text-based formats supported by Google) from Google search results.
- If other pages point to your page with descriptive text, Google could still index the URL without visiting the page. If you want to block your page from search results, use another method such as password protection or noindex.
