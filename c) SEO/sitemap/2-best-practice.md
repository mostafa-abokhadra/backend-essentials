### sitemap best practice

The most overlooked best practices are related to the **size limits**, **sitemap location**, and the **URLs included** in the sitemaps.

1. **Sitemap size limits**: 50MB (uncompressed) or 50,000 URLs
2. **Sitemap file encoding and location**: The sitemap file must be UTF-8 encoded, a sitemap affects only descendants احفاد of the parent directory. Therefore, a sitemap posted at the site root can affect all files on the site, which is where we recommend posting your sitemaps.
3. **Referenced URLs' properties**: use the complete, absolute URL: https://www.example.com/mypage.html.
