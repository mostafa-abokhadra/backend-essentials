### srcset
The `srcset` attribute in HTML is used with the `<img>` tag to provide multiple image options for different screen sizes, resolutions, or device capabilities. This allows browsers to choose the best image file to load based on the screenâ€™s resolution and size, helping to improve loading performance and image clarity across devices.

Here's how it works:

```html
<img src="default-image.jpg" 
     srcset="small-image.jpg 500w, 
             medium-image.jpg 1000w, 
             large-image.jpg 1500w" 
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 500px, 
            (max-width: 1200px) 1000px, 
            1500px" 
     alt="Description of the image">
```

### Explanation of `srcset`
- **`srcset`**: Lists multiple image sources, each with a file name and a width descriptor (e.g., `500w`, `1000w`). The browser selects the most appropriate image based on the current screen width and resolution.
    - `small-image.jpg 500w` means that `small-image.jpg` is 500 pixels wide.
    - `medium-image.jpg 1000w` means that `medium-image.jpg` is 1000 pixels wide.
    - `large-image.jpg 1500w` means that `large-image.jpg` is 1500 pixels wide.

### Explanation of `sizes`
- **`sizes`**: Specifies the display width of the image in CSS pixels for different viewport conditions. This helps the browser pick the correct image from `srcset`.
    - `(max-width: 600px) 500px` means that if the viewport width is 600px or less, the image will be displayed at 500px wide.
    - `(max-width: 1200px) 1000px` means that if the viewport width is between 601px and 1200px, the image will display at 1000px wide.
    - `1500px` (without a condition) applies if none of the previous conditions are met.

### Benefits of `srcset`
- **Optimizes Image Loading**: Loads smaller images on smaller screens and high-resolution images on larger screens or devices with higher pixel density.
- **Improves Page Speed**: Reduces load time for mobile users by downloading smaller images.
- **Enhances Image Quality**: Provides high-quality images for high-DPI (e.g., Retina) displays.

### Example Without `sizes` (Responsive to Device Pixel Ratio)
```html
<img src="default-image.jpg" 
     srcset="small.jpg 1x, large.jpg 2x" 
     alt="Sample image">
```
- Here, the browser selects `small.jpg` for regular screens and `large.jpg` for high-resolution (2x) screens.

Using `srcset` ensures responsive images, enabling better user experiences on various devices by loading images optimized for different conditions.
